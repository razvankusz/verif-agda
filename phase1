Subject: Phase 1 - Kusztos: Verified functional data structures and algorithms in agda

Phase 1 Project Selection Status Report

Name: Razvan Kusztos

College: Girton

User Identifier: rek43

Director of Studies: Chris Hadley

Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.

Based on Okasaki's book on efficient functional data structures,
I plan on implementing some datastructures that use these principles
as well as operations on them in Agda. The dependent typing allows
developing proofs about the datastructures and also enforce invariants
in the typing systems. It would also be interesting to see what benefits
using a dependently typed programming language brings in terms of expresivity.
Exactly what datastructures is still under consideration. I could start
by implementing finger trees as a general purpose data structure
and then building up to more complicated ones. There are also some
good resources on disjoint sets.

2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.

3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any
computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own
machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported
software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial
extra disc space on the MCS.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.

I will also be using my laptop, but will save all progress on the MCS machine.
